# scientificVisualization
The scientific visualization project

Build a version of VTK (we used 8.0.0)
Change the VS project settings to reflect the installed version of VTK
Do not forget the change the included library files if you install a new version of vtk
Now it should build.
To run, add the VTK bin folder to your path or copy the files to the project exe directory.
